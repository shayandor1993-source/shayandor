### Digital Marketplace App Prompt

---

### General Description

We want to develop a new application that serves as a **Marketplace for digital items**.  
Users will be able to sell and buy event tickets, credits, vouchers, coupons, and any other digital item.  

**Goal:** Create a simple, convenient, and fast user experience ‚Äì items should be displayed clearly, the buying and selling process should be easy, and the overall feel must be modern and user-friendly.

### Main Use Case

1. **Seller:**  
   - Registers in the app and logs in.  
   - Uploads an offer to sell a digital item.  
   - The offer includes:  
     - Title  
     - Description  
     - Asking price  
     - Category (e.g., concerts, restaurants, vacations, etc.)  
   - The item appears on the main marketplace board.  

2. **Buyer:**  
   - Enters the main board and sees the latest offers.  
   - Can select a specific item:  
     - Buy at the asking price  
     - Or propose a lower price (as a ‚Äúbid‚Äù).  
   - After purchase or bid, the seller receives a notification and decides whether to approve.
